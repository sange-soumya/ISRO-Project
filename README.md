# 🛰️ ISRO Project – Flask GUI Automation Tool

## 🚀 Overview
This project was developed during my internship at **UR Rao Satellite Centre (ISRO)**.  
It automates the execution of **ADA-based Linux utilities** such as `rrrMMU` and `exe` used in satellite subsystem development.

The tool provides a **web-based GUI (built with Flask)** where engineers can upload `.map`, `.lst`, and `.txt` files, process them automatically, and download the output files.

## 🧠 Key Features
- 🔹 Upload `.map`, `.lst`, and `.txt` files via a clean Flask UI  
- 🔹 Run backend ADA-based tools automatically using Python `subprocess`  
- 🔹 Generate `.2` output files and provide download options  
- 🔹 Reduce manual command-line operations  
- 🔹 Improve processing accuracy and save time

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (Flask), Python Subprocess Module, Bash Script
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
- **System Tools:** ADA-based Linux utilities (`rrrMMU`, `exe`)
- **Hosting:** Local or internal ISRO server
